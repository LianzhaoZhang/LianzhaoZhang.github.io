### Project Overview

- Undergraduate Innovation and Training Project, Entry for the 8th National Undergraduate Mechanical Innovation Design Competition
- Duration: May 2018 - May 2019
- Role: Team Leader
- Research Motivation: Pineapple harvesting in China mainly relies on manual labor, requiring substantial manpower. Therefore, we proposed developing an automatic pineapple harvesting prototype to reduce the labor intensity of pickers.
- Achievement: First Prize in Shaanxi Provincial Competition, project concluded with excellent rating

### Main Contributions

- Designed grasping and harvesting mechanisms for the harvesting machine, created complete 3D model of the harvesting machine
- Implemented binocular camera-based system for pineapple fruit recognition and localization, enabling the harvesting mechanism to execute grasping tasks
- Developed automatic pineapple harvesting prototype machine and validated the feasibility of the equipment and algorithms
