### Project Overview

- National First Prize Winner in the 4th "Dongfanghong Cup" National College Student Intelligent Agricultural Equipment Innovation Competition
- Duration: December 2018
- Research Motivation: Based on the competition theme, to solve the problems of mechanized lacquer tree harvesting, reduce the labor intensity of lacquer workers, and improve labor efficiency, an intelligent lacquer tapping equipment was designed.

### Main Contributions

- Designed a spiral lifting mechanism that enables remote-controlled equipment to ascend or descend spirally on tree trunks
- Developed blade trajectory planning matching incision shape requirements to maximize lacquer yield while minimizing tree damage
- Implemented microcontroller control system with wireless signal transmission and reception, enabling automated lacquer tapping operations through button control
