### Project Overview

- Undergraduate Thesis Project
- Duration: September 2019 - April 2020
- Research Motivation: When underwater hexapod robots move, their feet contact the ground, which makes the robot less affected by water flow during movement. The leg is an important locomotion and execution mechanism of hexapod robots. Reasonable leg structure design is of great significance for reducing robot control complexity, improving work efficiency, and preventing motion interference. This project designed an underwater hexapod robot leg structure to lay the foundation for the subsequent development of the complete underwater hexapod robot.

### Main Contributions

- Analyzed the impact of leg joint numbers on robot overall degrees of freedom and the impact of leg link lengths on complex terrain traversability, determining link configuration and parameters
- Established kinematic model, performed multi-body dynamics and hydrodynamics analysis, and determined some dynamic parameters based on finite element analysis
- Verified the rationality of leg structure, dynamics, and trajectory planning through simulation
